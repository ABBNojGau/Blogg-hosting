I recently tried the Consommé recipe from Fine Dining Today, and I have to say, I was disappointed. As a soup enthusiast, I was excited to try a new recipe, but unfortunately, this one didn't live up to my expectations.

## Flavor

The flavor of this soup was bland and unremarkable. It lacked any depth or complexity that I was expecting from a consommé. I could taste the salt and pepper, but that was about it. There was no distinct taste of vegetables, herbs or spices.

## Texture

The texture of this soup was uninteresting, with no variation in texture. It was a clear soup, and I was expecting it to have a more substantial body. It was thin and watery, without any chunky bits of vegetables or meat that could give it some texture.

## Difficulty

This recipe was easy to make, which was the only good thing about it. However, it wasn't worth the effort. The instructions were straightforward, but the end result was disappointing.

## Overall Rating

Overall, I give this Consommé recipe a 2-star rating. It was underwhelming and not worth the effort. I was expecting a flavorful and complex soup, but this one fell short. If you're looking for a soup recipe to impress your guests, I would recommend looking elsewhere.
